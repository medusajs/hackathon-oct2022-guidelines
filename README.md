# Medusa Hackathon 2022 - README Guidelines

![Medusa Hackathon 2022](hackathon-banner.jpg)

This repository acts as a template for GitHub submissions to Medusa's Hackathon 2022. It includes all the rules and guidelines that the README file of your GitHub submission must follow.

> You can submit your project in [this discussion thread](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/discussions/2280).

## Example Repository

You can check [this example repository](https://github.com/suhailkakar/react-native-medusajs) of how the expected README should look like.

## Project Name

### Cover Image

The header of your GitHub repository must include a cover image that gives an overview of your submission.

You can use [our template cover photos](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1157643826098186093) on Figma to create your own.

For example, if your submission is revolved around building a storefront for Medusa with a frontend framework, you can create a cover image with the Medusa logo and the logo of your frontend framework.

### Demo Link

If you have hosted your submission for demo purposes, please include a link to the demo right after the cover image.

If you also publish your submission on NPM (if applicable), include a link to it here.

## About

### Participants

In this section, include the GitHub handles of everyone in your team, including yourself.

Please also share their Twitter and Discord handles as it makes it easier for us to make shout-outs and contact you in case your project ends up as a winner.

### Description

In this section, give a description of what your submission is. It should be a maximum of 100 words, and it should revolve around Medusa and how your submission customizes it or what it adds to it.

### Preview

In this section, include any type of preview elements that would give an insight into what your submission looks like. It can be GIFs, images, videos, or anything similar.

Some examples of previews based on repository type:

- For storefront submissions, GIFs are highly recommended that showcase the entire flow (products list, add to cart, checkout, etc…)
- For integration submissions, images that showcase the integration between Medusa and the tool or service used are recommended.

## Set up Project

This section should cover how to set up and run the project locally. It’s intended to help the Medusa team properly review your submission, as well as help the community to benefit from your submission.

### Prerequisites

If running your submission requires any prerequisites, make sure to list them in this section.

Examples of Prerequisites:

- Medusa Server (Link to [Quickstart](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) here).
- Create an account in service X (for integrations with other services).
- Redis, PostgreSQL, or any of Medusa’s configurations or plugins.

### Install Project

In this section, cover step by step how to run your submission, with each step having a code block example of the command if applicable.

For example:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone XXX
```

1. Change directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd directory
npm install
```

## Resources

In this section, include links to Medusa’s GitHub repository and documentation. If you think there are any specific documentation pages that can be helpful to understand your submission more, include these specific pages.
